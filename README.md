# Dialog State Tracking Challenge 5 (DSTC5)

Dialog state tracking is one of the key sub-tasks of dialog management, which defines the representation of dialog states and updates them at each moment on a given on-going conversation. To provide a common testbed for this task, the first Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) was organized. More recently, Dialog State Tracking Challenges 2 & 3 and Dialog State Tracking Challenge 4 have been successfully completed.

In the fifth challenge, we will continue evaluating the dialog state tracking task on human-human dialogs. Different from DSTC4, in this challenge we will focus on cross-language DST. In addition to this main task, we also propose a series of pilot tracks for the core components in developing end-to-end dialog systems based on the same dataset.

More details about the challenge can be found from the official website (http://workshop.colips.org/dstc5/index.html).

This repository provides the resources including evaluation scripts and ontology for the challenge participants.
